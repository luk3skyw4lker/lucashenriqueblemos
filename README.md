The code available is the code used on my portfolium, which is entirely build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), it was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). And I'm continuously adding new features and data to it.

If you want to contribute or clone it for your own use, feel free to it! I would appreciate :)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learn More

Here are some links if you want to learn about Next.js. The interactive tutorial is dope! I have a version available on [next-learn-app](https://github.com/luk3skyw4lker/next-learn-app) on GitHub and [https://next-learn-app-am4sxzfk5.vercel.app/](https://next-learn-app-am4sxzfk5.vercel.app/) on Vercel Platform.

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Deploy on Vercel

This project is already deployed on [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), and I totally recommend it. It's a very intuitive and easy platform.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
